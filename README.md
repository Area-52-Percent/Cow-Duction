# Cow-duction: The Milkening

Cow-duction is a fun and charming multiplayer experience where you play as part of an alien duo abducting cows at night. While being attacked by farmers, you must protect your ship to return to your home planetâ€¦ But, who really are these aliens?

## Area 52%

We're a team of 7 students (+ 2 freelancers) at Drexel University, tasked with building a game for the [Voyager motion platform](https://vimeo.com/mosimlab).

## Building

Cow-duction is being developed in **Unity 2019.1.8**. To build an executable, you must have that version of Unity installed, download the `Cow-duction` folder or clone the repository, then open the project folder in Unity. Choose `File` > `Build and Run` to create a local build. The current target platform is Windows, but this can be changed through `File` > `Build Settings`.

Note: The data folder *must* be in the same folder as the executable in order for it to run!
