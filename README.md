# Cow-Duction

Cow-Duction is a wacky, cartoonish, and interactive theme park attraction for multiple players. Two people experience the game inside a motion simulator, cooperatively piloting an alien spaceship to abduct dairy cows in a 3D environment. People waiting in line can use mobile devices to defend the cows from the dairy-deficient aliens. This attraction creates a unique, asymmetrical player-versus-player experience thatâ€™s fast-paced fun for everyone!

# Area 52%

We are Drexel University students tasked with building a game for the [Voyager motion platform](https://vimeo.com/mosimlab) in Game Development: Workshop I/II.

## How to Play Cow-Duction

Although the game is meant to be played on a motion platform with Xbox controllers, there are options for playing a desktop or browser version with a mouse and keyboard.
