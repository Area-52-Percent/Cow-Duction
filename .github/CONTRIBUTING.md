## How to Contribute

### Report a Bug
Before submitting a report, take a shot at fixing it yourself, then create a fix branch and submit a pull request if you think you've solved it.

If you need additional assistance:
* Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/Area-52-Percent/Cow-Duction/issues) tab
* Check to see if the bug has already been reported
* If no issue matches your bug, press "New issue"
* Fill out the Bug Report template and press "Submit new issue"

### Submit a Pull Request
Pull requests are used to merge new features or fixes into `dev` and eventually `master`.

Before submitting a pull request, make sure that your branch is up to date with the latest changes from its base branch (merge the base branch into your branch), and resolve any merge conflicts if necessary.

When you're ready:
* Go to the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Area-52-Percent/Cow-Duction/pulls) tab
* Press "New pull request"
* Choose a base branch and compare it with your branch
* Press "Create pull request"
* Write a brief description of the major changes as the title, and a more detailed summary as the comment
* (Optional) Add reviewers, assignees, labels, projects, or a milestone
* If your branch is a fix for an issue, link the issue
* Press "Create pull request"

Thanks!
