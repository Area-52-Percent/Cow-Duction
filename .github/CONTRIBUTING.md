## How to Contribute

### Report a Bug
Before submitting a report, take a shot at fixing it yourself, then create a fix branch and submit a pull request if you think you've solved it.

If you need additional assistance, follow these steps:
* Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/Area-52-Percent/Cow-Duction/issues) tab
* Check to see if the bug has already been reported
* If no issue matches your bug, press "New issue"
* Fill out the Bug Report template and press "Submit new issue"

### Submit a Pull Request
Pull requests are used to merge new features or fixes into `dev` and eventually `master`.

Before submitting a pull request, make sure that your branch is up to date with the latest changes from its base branch, and resolve any merge conflicts if necessary.

To do so:
* Go to the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Area-52-Percent/Cow-Duction/pulls) tab
* Press "New pull request"
* Choose a base branch and compare it with your branch
* Press "Create pull request"
* Write a brief description of the major changes as the title, and a more detailed summary as the comment
* (Optional) Add reviewers, assignees, labels, projects, or a milestone
* If your branch is a fix for an issue, link the issue
* Press "Create pull request"

Thanks!
